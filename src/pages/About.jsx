        content: "There is no place for patient blame. There is no concept of 'patient non-compliance' at First Care Medical Clinic. Instead, we see it as our professional duty to consistently meet the patients needs. If a patient misses an appointment, it is our responsibility to reschedule. If we do not hear from a patient, it is our responsibility to keep calling to make contact. If a patient does not talk openly, it is our responsibility to create an environment where a patient feels comfortable sharing. We are dedicated to doing everything possible to provide patients with the highest quality of care."

We unequivocally recognize behavioral health conditions as medical problems. Behavioral health challenges are health challenges that deserve the same level of attention, understanding, and evidence-based treatment as any other physical health condition."

We are committed to actively listening, understanding your perspective, and consistently working to earn your trust. Patient trust is earned not given. We have to earn it."
